# Sorting_algorithms
Uni project

This project aims to evaluate the performance of six different sorting algorithms: merge sort, heap sort, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort and quick sort depending on the different types of input data: random, decreasing, increasing, A-shaped and V-shaped. All data is sorted in descending order.
